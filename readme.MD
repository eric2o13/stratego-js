Setup for building a Stratego AI in JS.

![alt text](/peek.gif)

## Usage

Run this command to watch two algorithms play a bunch of random moves.

```
    $ node cli
```

Go ahead and edit the `example-ai.js` or the `basic-ai.js` file to improve the algorithm.


Or, alternatively, use the web version by opening the index.html. No dev server needed.
